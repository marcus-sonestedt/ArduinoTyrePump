# ArduinoTyrePump

Arduino code to inflate/defate a kart tyre to the set pressure.

 * 12 digital outputs used to control 4-digit seven aegment display (show current/set pressure)
 * Two digital outputs via relays
    - compressor on/off
    - deflation open/close
 * Two analog inputs
    - potentiometer to set desired pressure
    - air pressure transducer to read current pressure
 
 This uses 14 digital ouputs, which is max for a small Ardiuno.
 
 # Constibuting
 
 Currently WIP / prototype stage. Schematic will be added later.
